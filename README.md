# YCSB Client for PoCF

Inspired by [this repo](https://github.com/penberg/ycsb-rs). Many thanks to Pekka and Alex Chi for releasing it. This client is used to generate the YCSB workloads from a template file (.toml) and evaluate the performance of the remote database supported by Proof-of-being-forgotten Compliant Framework (PoCF) which runs inside a secure TEE (e.g., SGX, SEV, etc.). 

The author(s) do not (and will not) pay any other efforts to support other database types as this is not our major focus for the time being. If you are interested in benchmarking database using Rust, consider to contact Yahoo or other experienced people.

## For USENIX Artifact Evaluation
